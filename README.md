# Three.js Card Game Application WIP

Mainly created to experiment with pushing multiple obj files through arrays, and map animations/tweens.
In the future, using a sole .fbx file is superior, or simply exporting the entire scene in Blender.
Tweens are still useful when doing simple positional/rotational animations with easing.
